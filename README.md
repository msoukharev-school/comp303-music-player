# COMP303: Winter 2020 Final Solution


## Abstract
---
I believe this code will be useful for a CS or SWE student taking *COMP 303: Design Patterns* or a similar course. In this repository, you can find correct implementation of multiple OOP and Java design patterns.

### The following topics appear in the source code

1. Modifiers, encapsulation, mutability, equality
2. Polymorphism, interfaces, abstract classes
3. Iterable, Iterator
4. Data sctructures
5. ***Strategy*** design pattern
6. ***Subscriber and Publisher***, Callbacks
7. Unit testing, *JUnit*
8. Defensive design

## Context
---
Due to COVID-19 and the associated measures put in place by McGill University, the Winter 2020 final season was held online. The students were given a task to implement a set of features. The idea was to determine the most appropriate design patterns and JUnit tests, which were demostrated and discussed during the semester, and use them for a nice and clean implementation.

My solution received an A.
