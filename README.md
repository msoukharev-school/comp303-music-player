# COMP303: Winter 2020 Final Solution


# Overview

I believe this code will be useful for a CS or SWE student taking *COMP 303: Design Patterns* or a similar course. In this repository, you can find correct implementation of multiple OOP and Java design patterns. Got an A.

## The following topics appear in the source code

1. Modifiers, encapsulation, mutability, equality
2. Polymorphism, interfaces, abstract classes
3. Iterable, Iterator
4. Data sctructures
5. ***Strategy*** design pattern
6. ***Subscriber and Publisher***, Callbacks
7. Unit testing, *JUnit*
8. Defensive design
